# Java Bindings for IETF-defined YANG models

This directory contains YANG models defined by the IETF. There are two major groups based on the process used
to maintain them:

- [IANA-maintained](iana), updated via the [Protocol registries process](https://www.ietf.org/process/iana/)
- [IETF-maintained](rfc), updated via the [RFCs process](https://www.ietf.org/process/rfcs/)

The artifacts themselves are supported by a shared [parent pom.xml](bundle-parent).
